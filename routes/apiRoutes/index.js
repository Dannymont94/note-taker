// create GET /api/notes route to read db.json and return all saved notes as JSON

// create POST /api/notes route to recieve a new note to save on the request body, add it to the db.json file, and then return the new note to the client.
  // need to give each note a unique id when it's saved

// BONUS: create DELET api/notes/:id route containing the id of a note to delete. Will need to read all notes from the db.json file, 
  // remove the note with the given id property, and then rewrite the notes to the db.json file.
